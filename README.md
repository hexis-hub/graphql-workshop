# Training Center Workshop

## Demistifying GraphQL: theory and practice to understand it for once

This project is a boilerplate made to be used in the Training Center Lisbon Workshop: https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/Training-Center-LX/events/259545468/

The master branch has everything necessary to start the project. It has a working example that fetches and display a hard-coded list of todos.

Feel free to fork this repo and create your own GraphQL project.
